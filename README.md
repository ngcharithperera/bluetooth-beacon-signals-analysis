# bluetooth-beacon-signals-analysis-tool
This tool creates heatmaps based on BLE beacon signal strengths

This tool can be used to generate heat-maps using BLE beacon signal strength data as shown below. The tool can crawl through a data set automatically and generate different heat-maps accordingly. It automatically saves heat-maps in a output folder.
